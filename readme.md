Software Engineer specializing in cross-platform mobile development with Flutter. I build elegant, performant applications and love solving complex problems.

My interests extend beyond the client-side. I'm actively building my full-stack skills using .NET for backend development and enjoy exploring low-level concepts, new languages, and cutting-edge technologies. As a hobby, I'm also diving into game development and graphics programming to satisfy my feel for aesthetics and efficient engineering.

Let's build something awesome together!
